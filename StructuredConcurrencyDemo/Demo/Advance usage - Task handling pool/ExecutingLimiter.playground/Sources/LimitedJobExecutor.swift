/*
 The following code is just a potential implementation of a custom executor to manage executing jobs with a pool.
 However, it's event not the good practice for now since the proposal `Custom Actor Executors` didn't introducing
 the `Specifying Task executors` within it.

 Additionally, the function runSynchronously completes immediately after executing the job.
 Therefore, it's suitable for creating an Executor to make jobs execute serially or on the same thread.
 However, it does not work for managing execution resources

 For the context of `Specifying Task executors`, please refer to here:
 https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0392-custom-actor-executors.md#specifying-task-executors
